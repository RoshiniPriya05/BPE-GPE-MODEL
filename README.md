# BPE-GPE-MODEL
A comprehensive comparison framework for Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and Gaussian Process Embedding (GPE) models. This project implements both text encoding methods with benchmarking tools to evaluate their performance on vocabulary coverage, encoding efficiency, semantic similarity preservation, and computational metrics.
